## SRAF overview ##
Stablecoin risks were long overlooked—until Terra’s 2022 collapse exposed the flaws. This report introduces the Stablecoin Risk Assessment Framework (SRAF) to close that gap.

SRAF evaluates both custodial and non-custodial stablecoins across eight key risk areas, from

* Asset Backing,
* Stability Mechanism,
* Issuance & Redemption,
* Liquidity,
* Governance,
* Smart Contract,
* Oracle
* Regulatory Risk

Instead of a single score, it offers a guidline to produce a clear, multi-dimensional risk profile.

Ultimately, SRAF supports the creation of standardized stablecoin risk assessment to boost transparency and trust in the ecosystem. It serves as a valuable guide for:

* Direct users holding or using stablecoins
* Investors evaluating stablecoin projects
* DeFi protocols integrating stablecoins
* Centralized exchanges (CEXs) listing stablecoins
* Regulators assessing systemic risk
