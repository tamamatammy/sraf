# Defining stablecoin risk

The key concerns arising from stablecoin users are often relating to the stability of the stablecoin value. These users are the ones that have exposure to stablecoin. There are four key events that could have significant negative impacts on stablecoin users:

- **stablecoin price becomes too volatile over time**. When the price of a stablecoin becomes unstable, users may incur losses if the price deviates significantly either rising too high or falling too low.

- **stablecoin price significantly lower than pegged value**. f a stablecoin's price falls significantly below its pegged value, recovery may not be possible. In such cases, holders could face permanent losses, forced to accept a "haircut" on their holdings as part of the stablecoin’s value is lost.

- **complete failure of the stablecoin**. In worst-case scenarios, the stablecoin’s value could plummet to zero, with no possibility of recovery. Users would lose the entirety of their holdings.

- **Inaccessible stablecoin value**. Although the stablecoin value remains unaffected, users may be unable to access or use the asset due to external factors such as censorship by centralised entities.

Stablecoin users face different types of losses depending on how they interact with the asset:

- **direct holders:** If users hold stablecoins directly, they risk losses when forced to sell at a price lower than their purchase price. If the stablecoin experiences a depeg, users may take a "haircut" on the original pegged value, or in extreme cases, lose their entire investment in the event of a project failure or censorship.

- **Leverage users:** Those who leverage stablecoins risk incurring losses if they need to purchase stablecoins at a high price to repay debt.

- **lenders:** Stablecoin lenders may suffer losses if their collateralised lending positions are liquidated due to the stablecoin’s value dropping below required thresholds.

- **Liquid providers:** Users providing liquidity to pools risk losses if the stablecoin does not recover to the value at which they originally provided liquidity.
