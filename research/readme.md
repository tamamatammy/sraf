# Stablecoin Risk Assessment Framework
## Introduction

Historically, stablecoin popularity was driven by market metrics like market share and market cap. However, the collapse of Terra in October 2022 served as a wake-up call for the crypto industryâ€”could this disaster have been avoided? The answer is yes, but only by acknowledging and managing the inherent risks associated with stablecoins.

In the first part, we analyse the key challenges for stablecoin risk assessment, including a review of existing approaches and case studies of two major depeg events: the collapse of Terra and the temporary depeg of USDC.

The second section introduces the Stablecoin Risk Assessment Framework (SRAF) and explains how it can effectively analyse and evaluate stablecoin. The framework breaks down the stablecoin risk assessment into several categories, where stablecoins that have been assigned with the same value are exposed to similar types of risks. Given the complexity of stablecoin design and the current limitations of a fully data-driven approach, SRAF employs a hybrid method, combining both quantitative and qualitative assessments. Rather than providing a single overall risk score, the framework enables users to gain a deeper understanding of the various risks involved and the potential negative impacts associated with each type of risk.

The following are the risk categories and the recommended metrics for assessing each category:

In the third section, we introduce a new stablecoin risk assessment framework that evaluates risk across multiple dimensions and highlights the need for an overall stablecoin rating.
