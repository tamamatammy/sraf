# Stablecoin Risk Assessment Framework
## Introduction

Historically, stablecoin popularity was driven by market metrics like market share and market cap. However, the collapse of Terra in October 2022 served as a wake-up call for the crypto industryâ€”could this disaster have been avoided? The answer is yes, but only by acknowledging and managing the inherent risks associated with stablecoins.

In the first part, we analyse the key challenges for stablecoin risk assessment, including a review of existing approaches and case studies of two major depeg events: the collapse of Terra and the temporary depeg of USDC.
