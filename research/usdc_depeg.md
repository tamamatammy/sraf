# Case study: the temporary depeg of USDC
Silicon Valley Bank was shut by the US regulator on March 10, 2023. SVB was one of the six US banks that acted as custodians for USDC’s cash reserves at the time, but the size of the cash reserve stuck with SVB is unclear. As concern rises over USDC becoming uncer-collateralised, large amounts of USDC were sold in the secondary market, leading USDC trading below $1. 

Other stablecoins, especially the one with direct or indirect exposure to USDC also lost their peg. Like DAI, which enabled a 1:1 USDC-DAI swap at its Peg Stability Mechanism, depgged with USDC.  GUSD and USDP reserves were drained from PSM and a large amount of USDC was flushed into the Curve tripool.
