When a UST holder seeks to exit, they can either sell UST to the Curve UST 3 pool or burn UST by minting LUNA. However, UST was only backed by Terra’s native currency Luna, which has no other use apart from backing UST. If the UST demand goes up, Luna’s price goes up. If the UST’s demand goes down, Luna’s price goes down. In the crisis of confidence, UST holders try to exist and therefore Luna keeps going down. UST eventually became under-collaterallised. This is called the death spiral.
