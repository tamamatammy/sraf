# Current challenges of having a single rating
Several existing stablecoin risk frameworks use a traditional counterparty risk rating system by assigning a single score or rating to stablecoins after assessment. For instance, Bluechip Rating assigns letter grades (A to F), with A being the highest rating and F the lowest, while Moody’s Digital Asset Monitoring model predicts the probability of depegging.

While the simplicity of a single rating is appealing—making it easy to interpret and use—stablecoin users can only truly benefit from it if they understand two critical aspects: (1) what the overall rating is measuring, and (2) whether the analytical process behind the rating aligns with their individual risk tolerance and objectives.

**1. What the Overall Rating is Measuring**
Many current stablecoin comparisons tend to mix risk assessment with performance metrics (e.g., yield, supply, market cap). Without a clear definition of what the overall rating represents, users may be misled, interpreting performance factors as risk indicators.

**2. Subjectivity in the Rating Process and Alignment with Risk Appetite**
Stablecoin risk is multidimensional, making it difficult to weigh various risk factors equally. Different users prioritise different risks based on their objectives. For example, some may want to avoid custodian risk due to concerns about centralised entities managing reserves, while others may prioritise smart contract risk and prefer off-chain reserves.

Traditional counterparty rating systems often rely on both expert judgement and data models to quantify risk, using historical data—such as past default events—to assign weightings to risk categories. However, applying this approach to stablecoin risk is challenging. Many stablecoins, especially newer ones with novel designs, have limited transaction data and no history of depegging, making it difficult to build a comprehensive, data-driven model for risk assessment. As of now, a data-driven approach to stablecoin ratings is still underdeveloped.

In summary, assigning a single risk rating without a clear definition or an objective, tailored approach may fail to accurately reflect the inherent risks of stablecoins. This could prevent users from making informed decisions based on their personal risk preferences.
