# Regulatory Risk
After the fall of Terra, authorities in major jurisdictions have accelerated efforts to regulate and supervise stablecoins. Some sets to establish new regulatory regime specific for stablecoins (e.g. MiCA), and some have already taken actions using the existing frameworks (e.g. SEC). Although countries around the world take different approaches on how to regulate stablecoin, there are many similarities when it comes to key concerns and requirements. The two main questions that public authorities are seeking answers to are:

1. Do stablecoins pose risks to consumers and the broader economy?
2. Can stablecoins serve as a means of payment and a store of value?

## Authorities' Concerns
Authorities expect that stablecoins have been proven safe and robust first before they can be used. While they believe concerns arising around stablecoins are necessary to be addressed, they may enforce a change in regulations or take regulatory actions that may affect the stablecoin projects. We can summarise the four most discussed concerns from the authorities’ prospective:

### 1) Consumer protection and 2) market integrity. 
- Whether stablecoin consumers and investors are provided with sufficient and understandable information and disclosure about the stablecoin, the rights associated with them and the risks they preent. For example, poor transparency over stablecoin’s reserve and operations may mislead consumers to oversee risks, preventing them from making fully informed purchasing decisions.
  
- Whether stablecoin projects ensure 1:1 redemption in the primary market and fair pricing in the secondary market. The biggest concern is that consumers cannot exit their stablecoin positions without incurring a loss. For example, consumers might be forced to sell stablecoin at a price lower than the purchase price on the secondary market during a depeg event or they might fail to get 1:1 redemption due to issues like poor redemption process design or a loss of reserve values.

### 3) Financial Stability
Regulators worry that a failure or crisis of confidence in a widely used stablecoin could impact financial stability. There are discussions around the chance that large transactions involving stablecoin reserves may affect the traditional financial market. For example, large sales of the reserve asset during a stablecoin crisis could also move the reserve asset’s price down.

### 4) Illicit activities
Regulators worry that the use of stablecoin for illicit activities like money laundering, terrorist financing and malicious tax evasion might be overseen due to the anonymous nature of blockchain. 

## Potential Regulatory Actions
The regulatory risk posed to stablecoin users is the risk that action taken by authorities, or changes in laws and regulations may negatively impact the stablecoin projects, resulting in a loss in their stablecoin exposures. 

As the crypto sector is still relatively young, we are yet to see any mature regulatory frameworks in place. Based on the authorities’ responses to several significant crypto events (e.g. FTX failure, Terra crashed, Ripple lawsuit, etc) in the past, below are the actions that will be most likely taken by authorities for the ruling of stablecoin fallen out of the their defined regulatory framework, and these actions will potentially have the most significant negative impact to the stablecoin users:

- **Seizing reserves**. Authorities may seize reserves in their jurisdictions, directly impacting offchain reserve assets held by custodians within their legal reach. This can prevent stablecoin projects from accessing their reserves, potentially causing delays or a complete halt in stablecoin redemptions. Such actions can erode market confidence, leading to panic selling or a "run" on the stablecoin projects.

- **Censoring users**. Authorities  may require stablecoin projects to censor certain users to enforce financial crime controls. This can involve stopping users under suspicion from accessing their stablecoins. Such user censorship can be imposed by the offchain platform or the smart contract.er censorship can affect both custodial and non-custodial stablecoin users, as restrict

- **Delisting from CEX**. Authorities may cease trading of stablecoins in their jurisdiction by ordering centralised crypto exchanges to halt any trades involving the stablecoin in question. Exchanges that refuse to delist the stablecoin may be deemed non-compliant with regulations.

- **Imposing fines**. Authorities may impose fines on stablecoin projects within their jurisdiction. For example, in February 2021, Tether and its associated exchange, Bitfinex, settled with the New York Attorney General’s Office for $18.5 million over allegations of misrepresenting the backing of Tether's reserves. As part of the settlement, they were barred from operating in New York, although no charges were brought against them. 

- **Restricting operations**. Authorities may restrict stablecoin operations in their jurisdictions. For example, Libra faced significant regulatory scrutiny from U.S. and EU regulators, leading to a restructuring of the project. This regulatory pressure ultimately resulted in the project's rebranding and changes to meet compliance requirements. Despite these efforts, Diem's assets were sold to Silvergate Bank in early 2022, effectively ending the original project's ambitions.
