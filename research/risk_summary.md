# Risk Categories Summary
The proposed stablecoin risk assessment framework (also referred as SRAF) breaks down the stablecoin risk assessment into several categories, where stablecoins that have been assigned with the same value are exposed to similar types of risks. Due to the fact that stablecoin design is highly complicated and a fully data-driven approach is not ready to be used, SRAF adopted a hybrid approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Instead of having an overall risk score, the framework will allow stablecoin users to understand different types of risk involved and any potential negative impacts may be incurred when exposed to these risks.

Our goal is to build a stablecoin risk assessment framework that:
Measures stablecoin risk from different angles
Is easier for common stablecoin users (e.g. semi-crypto-expert and none-crypto-expert) to access stablecoin risk related information
Encourage more risk driven decisions rather than trend- or yield- driven decisions
