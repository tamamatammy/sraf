# Smart Contract

This is the risk related to programming bugs or logical errors in the stablecoin smart contracts. Smart contract bugs can create security loopholes and make the stablecoin protocol vulnerable to attacks. Some of the biggest losses in the crypto sector were related to smart contract hacks - for example, the Wormhole bridge loses ~$321M due to a smart contract exploit in 2022.

In general:
- **Custodial stablecoins** have lower smart contract risk since their minting and redemption contracts are relatively simple.

- **Non-custodial stablecoins**, which operate algorithmically on-chain, carry higher smart contract risk but can mitigate it through:
  - Regular code audits by professional auditing firms.
  - Proven operational resilience, measured by the time the protocol has run securely while handling significant assets.

The framework measures smart contract risk by assessing:
- How complex the smart contract code is
- How robust are the smart contracts in production: have the smart contracts survived for a long time while controlling large assets? Have bugs been found previously and how long ago
- Whether the code is audited and how were they audited
- How well the smart contract code has been tested

## Smart contract risk metrics
To evaluate and compare stablecoin governance models, the following risk metrics should be considered:
